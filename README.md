# Pacmann-Project
The Pacmann project is a collection of my projects during the bootcamp at Pacmann. The class I took was Analytics and Data Science for 1 year (October 2022 - October 2023). This project contains various materials including probability, data wrangling, and python. Folders describe the material in each class.
